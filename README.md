# BBS-Screen-Creator-V2022-With-Atascii-Support
This is an updated BBS screen creator with Atascii Support, a work in progress

This program will take a boring text screen and turn it into a really nice screen for your BBS. Note that the basic program needs work, but as usual I post updates
when I get a chance to work on them.


The way this program is written , you will need to take all of the folders and put them into a display foldr (named display) in your root directory
but you can change the location in the program. AN update will be coming tomorrow sometime as I am working on it today. Russ
